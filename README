LASER CONTROLLER

Link to the libraries: /Users/cedriclor/.platformio/lib

Includes the following refactored libraries:

-- TaskScheduler: TaskSchedulerDeclarations.h
INLINE Task() {};
- added a default constructor to the Task class
- reordered the params in the existing Task constructors -> scheduler has been put first
- undefaulted the scheduler param in the existing Task constructors (so that they not be interpreted as conflicting default constructors by the compiler, which triggers the ambiguous constructor call error)

-- painlessMesh: TaskScheduler.cpp:
line 15 commented out.
//#include <TaskScheduler.h>
The inclusion of TaskScheduler.h was conflicting with its inclusion into main.cpp and resulted in multiple function definitions.

Defined Tasks in painlessMesh source files:
- painlessMesh.h (composites of class painlessMesh)
line 268: Task              droppedConnectionTask;
line 269: Task              newConnectionTask;
- painlessMeshConnection.h (composites of class MeshConnection)
line 85: Task          nodeSyncTask;
line 86: Task          timeSyncTask;
line 87: Task          readBufferTask;
line 88: Task          sentBufferTask;
- painlessMeshSTA.h (composites of class StationScan)
line 29: Task task;
